"""Run the sample (`order_summary`) part of the dbt project.

The Northwind models are excluded on purpose. They live in the same dbt
project, but they depend on the `bronze` schema that the `northwind_ingest`
DAG creates, so a bare `dbt run` here would fail on eight staging models for
anyone who has not run that DAG yet. `--exclude tag:northwind` keeps the two
tutorials independent of each other, in either order.

See the `dbt_build_northwind` DAG for the Northwind side.
